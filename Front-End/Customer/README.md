## General Information
- The objective of the project is to provide a template for future developments that may consume third party APIs.

## Technologies and Techniques used
### Planning and Design:
- Since there is only one resource in the project, it was developmet partially with [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum). The duration was 1 month splited in 2-week sprints.
- The planning was done with the [User Story Mapping](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story-mapping/) technique, you can find the MVP map [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/sZ8TbKWJWJZQCgri0VfnDn/Shopping-App?node-id=2722%3A3621&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=2722%3A3620).
- The Wireframes implemented and to be on this project were build in Figma and can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/sZ8TbKWJWJZQCgri0VfnDn/Shopping-App?node-id=2689%3A6000&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=2689%3A5984&starting-point-node-id=2689%3A6000&show-proto-sidebar=1).
- The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CEhsK9lhT2MILYgbN9bh8OH6CijNRj3g/view?usp=sharing).
- The internal project architecture was implemented following the concepts of the [CLEAN Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
- Overal code documentation was done leveraging [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/).

### Front-end:
- ReactJS.
- Routing with [react-router v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
- Internal application state managed with the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
- CSS design with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
- Code Splitting was implemented to reduce loading wating times. This was achieved using [Dynamic Import API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) and [React Lazy loading components](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy).
- The web app is 100% responsive.

### Back-end:
- This web app is consumming a third party open-source API called [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It provides products for Ecommerce stores.
- The API calls are performed with the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
- Part of the data provided from API was stored in case the Fake Store API goes down or out of service.

### Testing:
- Unit testing was done.
- Test coverage is 25% and is increasing using Jest and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is being used.
- While testing, the project was run using the Chrome's Development Tools "Fast 3G" and "No Caching" options. So the app is ready for slow internet connections.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement
There are always room for improvement, in this project so far the thinkgs that can be improved are:
- Move the Back-end to work with its own API services.
- More Unit testing coverage.
- Use Redux instead of the React Context API.
